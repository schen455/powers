# powers Package

This is a minimal working example of my first R Package for STAT545!

## Installation

Package installation can be done directly by calling
`devtools::install_github("YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/powers")`

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

<div class="cell">

``` r
library(powers)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'powers'
#> The following object is masked _by_ '.GlobalEnv':
#> 
#>     square
square(c(2,4,5))
#> [1]  4 16 25
```

</div>
